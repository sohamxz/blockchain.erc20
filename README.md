# ERC-20 Token Standard

ERC-20 is a technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier. The standard was proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in November 2015 and has since become the most widely used token standard on the Ethereum network.

## Overview

ERC-20 defines a set of rules that Ethereum-based tokens must follow to be considered standardized and compatible with other ERC-20 tokens. These rules include the following:

- The token must have a name and a symbol.
- The token must have a fixed supply or a mechanism for creating new tokens.
- The token must have a function that returns the total supply of tokens.
- The token must have a function that returns the balance of tokens for a given address.
- The token must have functions that allow for transferring tokens between addresses.
- The token must have a function that allows an address to approve another address to transfer tokens on its behalf.
- The token must have a function that allows an approved address to transfer tokens on behalf of another address.

## Advantages of ERC-20

The ERC-20 standard has several advantages over other token standards:

- Compatibility: ERC-20 tokens are compatible with all wallets and exchanges that support the Ethereum blockchain. This makes it easy for developers to create new tokens and for users to manage them.
- Liquidity: Because ERC-20 tokens are compatible with so many exchanges, they tend to have high liquidity. This means that it's usually easy to buy and sell them.
- Interoperability: ERC-20 tokens can interact with other smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes it possible to create more complex applications that involve multiple tokens and smart contracts.

## Examples of ERC-20 Tokens

There are thousands of ERC-20 tokens in existence, with new ones being created all the time. Some of the most well-known ERC-20 tokens include:

- Tether (USDT): A stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar.
- Binance Coin (BNB): The native token of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.
- Uniswap (UNI): The governance token of the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

## Conclusion

ERC-20 is a widely used standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a set of rules that tokens must follow to be considered standardized and compatible with other ERC-20 tokens. This standard has several advantages, including compatibility, liquidity, and interoperability. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, it's likely that ERC-20 tokens will continue to play an important role in the development of decentralized applications.
